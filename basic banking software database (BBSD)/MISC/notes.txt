It sucks to have 4 weeks of planning go down the drain because of 1 simple thing I thought I knew but didn't. I didn't allocated enough time to build the header file and it wouldn't compile with it. So i'm sorry but I cannot include the header file in this release. 

I spent most of my time debugging and polishing it and I was going to build the header file an hour before the deadline, but as of 23:13 I still cannot get it to work. And research has shown its more complex than I orginally thought. I personally have never seen a language with a header file I figured it was the same as the main() class where you just copy it to the top of the fine and be done. 

But anyways, it works. its not great... and the header file I wrote is good enough for anyone to look over it and get the idea of whats going on.

If I had planned 2 hours out on the header file, it would be done. 

The account information is in the member.db

The structure goes as follows
Account #
Username
PAssword
First Name
Last Name
Cash
Bank
Account Type
Permissions (0 - 2) 0 = Cust, 1 = Empl 2 = Root.

So 
Brandan supersecret = admin
Employee supersecret = employee
Customer supersecret = customer
and anyone else you added.


I tried to add a detailed help screen... not sure of it though. It helped me at least.

I made a flowchart, it sucks too. 

It sucks knowing that I'm going to have to turn this in basically unpolished, unoptimised, and unfinished. It really does. 

This is one of the projects I wouldn't put my name on if I wrote it for the public to see. 

Besides that the only other problem I had was with the AccountType... what was I suppose to do with that? I made it more of a bank teller system than an ATM, I realised that at the end.
